Static data for the game Star Control: Origins.
The galaxy is litered with random crashed ships, modules and upgrades for your flagship, and of course resource units that fund your journey.

Ever think "Gee, it'd be nice if there was some way to browse star systems for all the goodies to be found?"

Well now you can!
